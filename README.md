# ML_POCs
Machine Learning (ML) , Proof of Concepts. This folder is designed to be a placeholder for those scripts and ideas for simple machine learning.

At the beginning, it will contain:

PYTHON/:

1. scikit-learn/
The simple easy-to-go scikit-learn library of Python. All POCs are placed here in first order. Due to the easy deployment that this library facilitates, it is convenient to use it to a better understanding of the models.

2. tensorflow/
The biggest, all-in-one library of all the times. It supports GPU accelaration natively, and can run code of scikit-learn as well as keras and other libraries. It also have a bunch of APIs to support the project.

3. keras/
The Neural Networks library for excellence. As "tf" have this module already implemented, all NN deployments (that are exclusive from scikit-learn), will be here.

R/: 
(to continue..)
